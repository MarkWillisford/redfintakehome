Good evening, thank you for taking a few minutes to evaluate my code.
The installation of dependencies is simple.
First Node:
For Mac, 
	Nodejs.org and find your download link (LTS version)
	Find the downloaded file and double click
	In your terminal you can enter node - v to verify that Node.js is installed correctly
For Linux
	In your terminal enter sudo apt install nodejs
	As before node -v will let you know that it has installed correctly
Once you have npm / Node.js installed you need two libraries installed with the following commands:
	npm i axios
	npm i moment
And finally, unzip and install my program the following command from the project folder:
	npm install -g 
The program can be ran with: 
	letseat
